Personal Website 2022

My very first from scratch React App! 
Though I am making a career change into tech I'm still very much an artist.
First impressions mean a lot to me so I've held myself to a very high standard in how I present myself online. 

Made using React Hooks, a lot of components, a lot of props, and a ton of hyperfocusing.
